🌧️ Rainfall Prediction in Australia 🌧️

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia using machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

📁 Project Overviewt

The project involves the following steps:

Dataset Preparation: Downloaded, cleaned, and preprocessed the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to rainfall.

Data Cleaning: Managed missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Data Visualization: Visualized key variables and relationships in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Created new features from the raw data to improve model performance.
Model Building: Built predictive models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Training: Trained the models and tuned hyperparameters to enhance accuracy.
Prediction: Made predictions on rainfall using the trained models and evaluated their performance.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains weather observations from various locations across Australia. You can find the original dataset on Kaggle.

🚀 How to Run the Project
